## I. Introduction
Wangshu Hotel Reservation is an online booking system for hotel reservations. Online booking systems have helped tour and activity companies save tens of thousands of hours of administrative work. Wangshu Hotel Reservation is a software and reservation system that makes it simple for customers to book and pay for hotel reservations.
